DESCRIPTION

    My vimrc configuration.  It uses a plugin manager that will ask to install
    plugins the first time vim is started with this vimrc.  You can change the
    list of (to be) installed plugins at the top of the vimrc.

INSTALL:

    cd ~/
    git clone git://github.com/ashleydev/.vim.git
    cd .vim/
    make  # creates symlink: ~/.vimrc -> ~/.vim/vimrc

REQUIREMENTS

    This vimrc requres >= vim 7.3 for full features.
